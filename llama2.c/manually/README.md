To modify run.c so it avoids using libc and relies only on pure C code, we need to remove or replace all libc functions and headers with custom implementations or alternative approaches. This involves handling I/O, memory allocation, string manipulation, mathematical operations, and system-specific operations without libc. Below, I'll outline what to remove and how to deploy necessary functions, then provide the modified code.

What to Remove
Headers:
<stdio.h>: Used for printf, fprintf, fopen, fread, fclose, fseek, ftell.
<stdlib.h>: Used for malloc, calloc, free, exit, atoi, atof.
<ctype.h>: Used for isprint, isspace.
<time.h>: Used for time, clock_gettime.
<math.h>: Used for sqrtf, powf, expf, cosf, sinf.
<string.h>: Used for strlen, strcpy, sprintf, strcmp, memcpy, memset.
<fcntl.h>, <unistd.h>, <sys/mman.h>: Used for file operations (open, mmap, munmap, close).
Functions:
I/O: All print and file functions.
Memory: malloc, calloc, free.
String: strlen, strcpy, sprintf, strcmp, memcpy, memset.
Math: sqrtf, powf, expf, cosf, sinf.
Character: isprint, isspace.
Time: time, clock_gettime.
System: open, mmap, munmap, close, exit.
How to Deploy Necessary Functions
I/O:
Remove output functions (printf, fprintf) since theyâ€™re not essential for core functionality. For deployment, assume output is handled externally or omitted.
Replace file loading (fopen, fread, etc.) with a preloaded memory buffer or system-specific calls if unavoidable.
Memory Management:
Use a static memory pool instead of dynamic allocation.
String Functions:
Implement custom versions of strlen, strcpy, strcmp, memcpy, memset, and a basic sprintf.
Mathematical Functions:
Implement approximations for sqrtf, powf, expf, cosf, sinf.
Character Classification:
Implement simple checks for isprint and isspace.
System and Time:
Remove timing and system calls, hardcoding necessary parameters.
